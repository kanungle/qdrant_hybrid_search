A parameterised template for the model to be fitted is also created based on a (possibly different) fiducial cosmology. This model reliance can be considered a form of data compression, and the data is then analysed allowing that the true answer is different from the fiducial cosmology assumed. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the fiducial cosmology assumed in the BAO analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey Data Release 1 (DR1) on the final measurements in DESI 2024 III. We utilise a suite of mock galaxy catalogues with survey realism that mirrors the DESI DR1 tracers: the bright galaxy sample (BGS), the luminous red galaxies (LRG), the emission line galaxies (ELG) and the quasars (QSO), spanning a redshift range from 0.1 to 2.1. We compare the four secondary AbacusSummit cosmologies against DESI's fiducial cosmology (Planck 2018). The secondary cosmologies explored include a lower cold dark matter density, a thawing dark energy universe, a higher number of effective species, and a lower amplitude of matter clustering. The mocks are processed through the BAO pipeline by consistently iterating the grid, template, and reconstruction reference cosmologies. We determine a conservative systematic contribution to the error of $0.1\\\\%$ for both the isotropic and anisotropic dilation parameters $\\\\alpha_{\\\\rm iso}$ and $\\\\alpha_{\\\\rm AP}$. We then directly test the impact of the fiducial cosmology on DESI DR1 data. \", 'user_id': 'user_3'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None), ScoredPoint(id=540, version=18, score=12.7242565, payload={'document': '  The [O III] 5007 line is commonly used as an indicator of the systemic redshift of AGNs. Also, recent studies have used the width of this emission line as a proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy. This paper calls both of these assumptions into question by analyzing a sample of approximately 400 AGN spectra from the first data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These spectra show that the low-ionization forbidden lines ([O II], [N II], [S II]) define a consistent redshift, but that the peak of the [O III] line is blueshifted in approximately half of the AGNs with respect to that redshift. For the sample studied here, the average shift is 40 km/s, with the largest shift being over 400 km/s. The magnitude of this shift is found to be correlated with a number of properties, including the width of the [O III] line and the Eddington ratio (L/L$_{Edd}$), derived from the luminosity and width of H-beta.

It is therefore important to compare both theoretical and observational results to a direct measure of the cluster mass. This can be done by measuring the gravitational lensing effects caused by the bending of light by the cluster mass distribution. In this review we discuss how this phenomenon can be used to determine cluster masses and study the mass distribution itself. As sample sizes increase, the accuracy of the weak lensing mass estimates needs to improve accordingly. We discuss the main practical aspects of these measurements. We review a number of applications and highlight some recent results.

The universe begins with a constant (Hagedorn) temperature and then transitions into an inflationary universe while preserving the Null Energy Condition (NEC). In such a universe time is presumably emergent, calling the age of the universe into question. We first consider the phase space of positive spatial curvature models within General Relativity and with matter sources that respect the NEC. Depending on the duration of the post-lingering inflation these models can produce a small amount of observable spatial curvature in the Cosmic Microwave Background. We also discuss how lingering can arise with or without spatial curvature in theories of quantum gravity when considering the thermodynamic scaling of particles and its impact on the early universe. The string theory dilaton is essential to the dynamics. There are many open questions that remain. ', 'user_id': 'user_3'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None)])"
